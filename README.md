# Coldwire - The Ultra‚ÄëParanoid Post‚ÄëQuantum Messenger
![Tests](https://github.com/Freedom-Club-Sec/Coldwire/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)  ![Coverage](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Freedom-Club-Sec/Coldwire/badge.svg?branch=main) [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/1c34011b18284a3cb349ffe5415eea53)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Freedom-Club-Sec/Coldwire/dashboard)

**Coldwire** is designed to survive *the worst attacks* and when operated correctly it offers significantly better security than any messenger currently available.

## üîí Security Model & Features
- **Best‚Äëcase security**: achieves [unbreakable encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) under the principles of information theory using [one‚Äëtime pads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) 
- **Worst‚Äëcase security**: falls back only to combined security of ML‚ÄëKEM‚Äë1024 and McEliece8192128  
- **Perfect-Forward-Secrecy**: on every [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) batch through ephemeral PQC key exchanges  
- **Plausible Deniability**: messages are not cryptographically tied to you, providing more deniability than [Off‚ÄëThe‚ÄëRecord messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-record_messaging) !
- **Mandatory SMP**: We enforce [Socialist millionaire problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_millionaire_problem) before any chat. **MiTM attacks are impossible**.  
- **Minimal Attack Surface**:  
  - Tkinter UI only, no embedded browsers or HTML
  - Minimal Python dependecies
  - All untrusted inputs truncated to safe lengths to prevent buffer‚Äëoverflow in liboqs or Tk  
- **Traffic obfuscation**: Network adversaries (ISP, etc) cannot easily censorship Coldwire, because we utilize HTTP(s).
- **Metadata‚ÄëFree**: Random 16‚Äëdigit session IDs, no server contacts, no logs, no server‚Äëside metadata, enforced passwordless authentication. Everything is local, encrypted, and ephemeral.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
While Coldwire enforces paranoid‚Äëlevel security features, the [protocol](https://github.com/Freedom-Club-Sec/Coldwire/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md), and codebase are under active development. 

**Do not** use for production‚Äëgrade secrecy until an formal audit is complete.
